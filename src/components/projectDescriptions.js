    cub3D: "cub3D is a 3D game engine project developed as part of the 42 Vienna curriculum. It recreates the classic Doom-style first-person shooter experience using raycasting techniques programmed in C. The project involves rendering a textured 3D environment from a 2D map, handling player movement and interactions, and simulating realistic perspectives and collisions. It demonstrates a deep understanding of graphics programming, low-level memory management, and algorithm optimization within strict coding standards.",

    minishell: "minishell is a project to recreate a simplified version of the bash shell. It supports basic shell commands, piping, redirection, and job control to deepen understanding of process management and system calls in C.",
